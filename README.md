Solidity Contract and Dafny Verification for Balance Tracking
Overview

This repository provides a simple Solidity smart contract, BalanceTracker, designed to manage user balances. The contract includes a deposit function that allows users to add funds to their accounts.

To enhance the reliability and security of the deposit function, we've employed formal verification using the Dafny verification tool. The Dafny specification ensures that the user's balance always increases after a successful deposit, preventing unintended consequences.
Getting Started



    Set Up Solidity Development Environment:
        Install a Solidity compiler (e.g., solc).
        Set up a development framework like Truffle or Hardhat.

    Deploy the Contract:
        Compile the Solidity contract.
        Deploy the compiled contract to an Ethereum network (e.g., Ethereum Mainnet, Goerli Testnet).

    Verify the Dafny Specification:
        Install the Dafny verifier.
        Run the Dafny verifier on the deposit function's specification.

Security Considerations

While this contract is relatively simple, it's essential to consider potential security vulnerabilities:

    Reentrancy Attacks: Implement a reentrancy guard pattern to prevent malicious re-entry.
    Integer Overflow/Underflow: Use SafeMath or similar techniques for safe arithmetic operations.
